                <h1>Feyzullah Deniz SARI</h1>
                Graduated as systems engineer and during early professional experience as a pilot required key skills such as adaptability, close collaboration, interpersonal coordination, as well as real time complex problem solving.
After 10 years in active aviation duty, I have been promoted to staff officer role due to my hard-working and consistancy. During 7 years experience as a staff officer at international wargame simulation centre and army corps level operational centre 44 projects completed and 7 badges, 2 awards, 62 letter of appreciation and 4 times early promotions gained in total. 
Have grown increasing interest in information technologies due to simulation and decision-making technologies engagement over the years and started using inherited skills in the IT field since 2017. Started as 1st and 2nd line support professional and manager. My analytical thinking, cognitive flexibility, emotional intelligence, creativity and communication skills were as important as technical skills. It was obvious that cloud technologies and automation bring best solutions for my customer, therefore last one year passionately studied and worked on Coud and DevOps technologies.
Passionate about engaging with team members not only to work collaboratively but also to share learning, experience, diving into new technologies and improvement. 
Able to prioritise, smart-working practises and friendly work environment while comfortable working under timeline pressure with competitive creative and productive environment. Able to demonstrate transferable skills such as self-discipline, organisational skills inherited from previous roles as a senior officer in aviation.
